## Overview

### The Project
The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and incorperating function programming priciples 
for easier development, navigation and testing.

### Rules:
You win if you are able to reveal all the tiles (non-mine) and mark all the mines.
- Reveal tile - left-click
- Mark tile - right-click
- Un-mark tile - right-click (again)

### Run
To Run the project, first install the packages using `npm install` then run `npm run start` to run the project.

### Tests
The project also has both unit tests, built using Jest testing library with 100% test coverage, and end-to-end tests, using Cypess.
- To run Unit Tests run:
     `npm run test`
- To run end-to-end tests:
     `npm run test:e2e`

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript Testing Library
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - End-to-End Testing Library
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript Compiler
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Build Tool

### What I learned

I learned how to incorporate functional programming principles. 
I also learned how to build tests, both unit and end-to-end tests

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified Js Course](https://javascriptsimplified.com/) - This helped me for build the project, by teaching me advanced js priciples and concept.
